# **The Way Of The Mapmaker**  

This is my thesis work created at the **University of Debrecen**. The game was built using the **Unity game engine**.

The game is a calm, roguelike, exploration game with elements of board games and strategy games. It features **procedurally created** maps to explore with several items, quests and cities. This game is a calm experience created for players who enjoy exploring new, interesting worlds.
Here’s a structured **GitHub README** for your project:  

## **Features**  
- **Exploration & Mapping** – Discover and chart new territories. Later sell these maps in towns to earn money.  
- **Dynamic World** – Procedurally generated landscapes to explore.
